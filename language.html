	<h3> Learn Languages.</h3>
	<img src="images/New York.jpg" class="center" float alt="Learn Languages.">
<p>I love languages and I know 3,5 of them. In this part I want to tell you about my very special relationship with languages. And I should start from the very beginning.</p>

<p>I’m from Ufa which is in Republic of Bashkortostan which is Russian Federation (Russia). As everyone knows in Russian Federation people speak Russian. However not everyone knows that in Russian Federation there are 35 different languages considered official in different regions along with Russian. Okay. I’m coming from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkortostan">Bashkortostan</a> and my family is Bashkir. In the Republic our second official language is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkir_language">Bashkir</a>. My grandma didn’t speak Russian at all. Me and my sisters went to Bilingual lyceum (Russian- Bashkir). That’s how I have learned my first two languages.</p>

<p>In Russia I guess as everywhere else people start learning English when they are very young. However, the fact of learning doesn’t necessary mean we know the language. There are plenty of people who study English for 20 years and cannot build a proper sentence. That was me before I moved to Moscow. No, it doesn’t mean that situation in Moscow is very different, I’d say kinda the same (I don’t know the numbers). In Moscow my colleague (he became my friend afterwards) could speak 3 languages fluently and he studied the fourth one. My first reaction was I started learning English. I studied English in Moscow, Paington (England), New York and only in Shanghai I decided enough. And now I know my ABC. That’s how I have learned my third language.</p>

<p>I’m in China. God knows how long it’s going to take me to say that I have learned this incredible language. Recently I took HSK test and scored 193 out 200. Not bad! I’m studying it now with a privet tutor and she is not easy on me. Hopefully that will help a lot.</p>

<p>Please, <a href="mailto:irinapenzina@mail.ru">contact me</a> if you are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone to practise any of those languages;</li>

<li>someone to get an advice how to study languages;</li>

<li>And if you have any other ideas.</li>
