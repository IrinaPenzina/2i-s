	<h3> Travel.</h3>
	<img src="images/Travel to places.jpg" class="center" float alt="Bali beach.">
<p>In 2012 I went abroad for the first time. My first country was Turkey also it was my first time to see the sea. Since then I have traveled to 11 countries to some of them multiple times. I really hope this list will only grow because I do love travelling.</p> 
<p>To be fair I should say my travelling goals changed a lot over time. I used to love going to famous cities London, New York, Paris, Zurich, Istanbul, etc to see other people, how they live. Specially arriving to a city in the early morning, everyone is rushing, doing their morning routines. It gives you the feeling that you are a part of it and something magical comes with it like if you are not a tourist but a local. Among all the touristy things I’d do something like going to a market or to some popular bar among locals and of course making friends. It’s like a short life in the city you visit which you live just a week. But still.</p>
<p>Since I moved to Shanghai, and here life is just overwhelming, I less look into cities, in terms of travelling, but more into how I feel. Like if I need to relax I would go to see the ocean/ mountains or go to yoga retreat and choose a place according to the season or price or convenience rather than the name of the country or the city.</p>
<p>I really want to do so many different things and it seems to me I will have to travel the world. I already know what I want to do for my next trip: I want to go to a whale safari.</p> 
        
<p>Please, <a href="mailto:irinapenzina@mail.ru">contact me</a> if you know anything about a whale safari, I just need an advice.</p>
