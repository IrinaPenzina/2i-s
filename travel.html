	<h3> Travel.</h3>
	<img src="images/Travel to places.jpg" class="center" float alt="Bali beach.">
<p>In 2012 I went abroad for the first time. The first country I went to was Turkey. Also it was my first time to see the sea. Since then I have traveled to 11 countries, some of them multiple times. I really hope this list will continue to grow because I do love travelling.</p> 
<p>To be fair I should say my travelling goals changed a lot over time. I used to love going to famous cities: London, New York, Paris, Zurich, Istanbul, etc to see other people and, how they live. I especially enjoy arriving to a city in the early morning, everyone is rushing, doing their morning routines. It gives you the feeling that you are a part of it and something magical comes with it, it feels as if you are not a tourist but a local. Among all the touristy things I’d do something like go to a market or to some popular bar among locals and of course make friends. It’s like a short life in a new city for a week. But still.</p>
<p>Since I moved to Shanghai, my life here is overwhelming, I look less into cities, in terms of travelling, but more into how I feel. For example, if I need to relax I would go to see the ocean/ mountains or go to a yoga retreat. Now I choose a place according to the season, price or convenience rather than the name of the country or the city.</p>
<p>I really want to do so many different things and it seems to me I will have to travel the world. I already know what I want to do for my next trip: I want to go to on a whale safari.</p> 
        
<p>Please, <a href="mailto:irinapenzina@mail.ru">contact me</a> if you know anything about a whale safari, I would love to hear your advice.</p>
