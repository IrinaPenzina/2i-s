<p>My entire life I thought that people who can code have some sort of a superhero power. It fascinated me how someone was able to create things to make other people’s life easier. When I was 30 years and 11 months old I started looking into it myself (Okay, also there was my friend who was constantly telling me that I’m going to like it), I found out either it’s not that complicated or I’m not as hopeless as I thought.</p>

<p>Before that beautiful coding enlightenment happened in my life I was busy with other things. Like when I lived in Russia I gained a Master’s degree in Public relations, for 5 years worked as a PR manager in various fields most of the time media related. After recent crisis (because of annexation of Crimea) I was made redundant and there was no career opportunities for me I decided to change my career path and a country. I became a certified English teacher and came to China. I’ve been in China for three years and here my beautiful coding enlightenment took place. (You can find my detailed CV on  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-penzina-81a3a39a/">LinkedIn</a> or just request it from me). </p>

<p>When I was diagnosed with love for coding - first, I talked to people, second, I started teaching myself html, css and JavaScript basics (thanks to SoloLearn, edX), third, I started going to different tech orientated events in town (Apparently, Shanghai has a lot). Finally, I decided to built this website to understand if I love coding as it seemed to me at the beginning.</p>

<p>Now I am sure that I really like website development.</p>
