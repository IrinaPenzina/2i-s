	<h3> Yoga.</h3>
	<img src="images/Retreat.jpg" class="center" float alt="Yoga retreat.">
<p>I have been doing yoga for almost five years. It helps me keep my mind and body healthy.</p>
<p>The first time I took a yoga class, was because of my doctor. He told me that it is exactly what I need to heal my back. At that time I constantly had terrible backaches all the time. They went away after months of intensive practice. However my backaches still come back if I stop doing yoga for sometime. That’s obviously what keeps me from quitting.</p>
<p>With yoga everything started as a work out just for my body, but with time I have found a new meaning to it as I have grown as a person. I had very dramatic changes in my life, I had my dreams crushed right before my very eyes along with so many other things. Every time when something like that happens my mind gets crowded with a whirlwind of thoughts and I become breathless. As you know what all yoga teachers say “breathe” and “be aware of your body/breath/thoughts”. And I breathe and I become aware. That’s all I need to save myself from whatever is going on outside of me, to fix myself from inside.</p>
<p>Twice I went to a yoga retreat here in China and I had an amazing experience.It benefited me physically and mentally. Yes, you go there with a group of people but it’s a rare case when a group doesn’t act as a group. Every single person being in the same place with many others has his or her own journey. The people are so beautiful there. It’s difficult to explain. I would definitely recommend going to a yoga retreat..</p>
<p>Now I’m doing yoga at home (usually <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/">yoga with Adriane</a>) if you want to do something yogi I’m down!</p>
<p>Please, <a href="mailto:irinapenzina@mail.ru">contact me</a> if you are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone to practice yoga with;</li>
<li>someone to talk to about yoga;</li>
<li>And if you have any other ideas.</li>
