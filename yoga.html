	<h3> Yoga.</h3>
	<img src="images/Retreat.jpg" class="center" float alt="Yoga retreat.">
<p>I’ve been doing yoga for almost five years. It something what helps me keep my mind and body healthy.</p>
<p>For the first time I took the class because of my doctor who told me that it’s exactly what I need to heal my back. I had terrible backaches all the time. They went away after some time of intensive practise. However they still come back if I stop my practise for sometime. That’s obviously what keeps me from quitting.</p>
<p>Everything started as a work out for my body in some time I’ve got a new meaning to it as I grew as a person. I had very dramatic changes in my life, I had my dreams crushing right before my very eyes and so many other things. Every time when it’s happening my mind will get crowded with various of thoughts and it will leave breathless. As you know what all yoga teachers say “breath” and “ be aware of your body/breath/ feelings”. And I breath and I become aware. That’s all I need to save myself from whatever is going on outside of me to fix myself from inside.</p>
<p>Twice I went to yoga retreats here in China and I had an amazing experience.It benefited me physically and mentally. Yes, you go there with a group of people but it’s that rare case when group doesn’t act as a group and every single person being in the same place has his or her own journey. And people are so beautiful. It’s difficult to explain. I would definitely recommend that if you are hesitating.</p>
<p>Now I’m doing yoga at home if you want to do something yogi I’m down!</p>
